# This project contains the basic and crucial variogram functions for resource estimation in geostatistical calculations.
- Variation of differences in sample values depending on distance is known as <i><b>spatial variation</b></i>. It is vital for evaluating mineral deposits.
- To see the graphs, you need to download "matplotlib" (Type 'python -m pip install matplotlib, pandas' in the terminal).
